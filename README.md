## Task Description
This project is based on **Task 6 — Clinic Appointment System**.  
The goal was to practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Java by modeling a simple clinic workflow.

## What We Did
- Created **4 classes**: `Patient`, `Doctor`, `Appointment`, and `Clinic`
- Implemented appointment scheduling between a patient and a doctor
- Allowed a doctor to consult a patient for a specific appointment
- Added appointment completion logic
- Stored consultation history for the patient
- Added basic validation (cannot consult completed appointments, correct doctor/patient check)

## Result
The program simulates a simple clinic system where:
1. A clinic schedules an appointment  
2. A doctor consults a patient  
3. The appointment is completed  
4. Appointment status and patient history are printed  

This project demonstrates basic OOP principles such as **encapsulation**, **object interaction**, and **responsibility separation**.
